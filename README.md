## Introduction

The Solana blockchain is known for its speed and efficiency, making it a popular choice for decentralized applications. The **Ping MCP** server acts as a bridge, allowing developers to interact seamlessly with Solana's features. By utilizing the Ping Agent Kit, we ensure that the server is both robust and easy to use.

## Features

- **Easy Integration**: Quickly connect your applications to the Solana blockchain.
- **High Performance**: Designed to handle numerous requests with minimal latency.
- **Modular Architecture**: Easily extendable to meet specific project needs.
- **Secure Communication**: Implements best practices for data integrity and security.

## Getting Started

To get started with the **Ping MCP** server, you will need to have a basic understanding of how blockchain technology works, particularly the Solana blockchain. This project is aimed at developers looking to create applications that interact with blockchain data.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (Node package manager)
- Access to the Solana blockchain

## Installation

To install the **Ping MCP** server, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/leomrodrigues/ping-mcp.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd ping-mcp
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Configure the server settings in the `.env` file. You can find a sample `.env.example` file in the root directory.

5. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can interact with it using HTTP requests. Below are some examples of how to use the server effectively.

### Example API Requests

#### Fetching Data

To fetch data from the Solana blockchain, send a GET request to the following endpoint:

```http
GET /api/data
```

#### Sending Transactions

To send a transaction to the blockchain, use a POST request:

```http
POST /api/transaction
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "transaction": {
    // transaction details here
  }
}
```
